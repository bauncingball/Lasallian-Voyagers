										2015 <br><br>
								 
								Faith stood with a frown as her mom yelled her sister. It usually happened nowadays and she couldn't do anything to stop it. <br><br>
								 
								It started with small things like dead rats in the corner of the house, mutilated and killed in disturbing ways. Until it turned into dogs with their eyes gouged out of their sockets. <br><br>
								 
								If she did, their mom might found out about her not being good. Hope didn't do the bad things but it wasn't Faith's fault either. <br><br>
								 
								He made her do it.  <br><br>
								 
								She looked to the side, a pair of feline eyes stared directly at her. <br><br>
								 
								He tempted her to do unspeakable things. <br><br>
								 
								And he was always watching. <br><br>
								 
								~•~•~•~ <br><br>
								 
								A few hours later <br><br>
								 
								An exotic smell wafted through the twins room as they slept. <br><br>
								 
								Hope barely registered her sister moving and her sister getting off the bed. <br><br>
								 
								She trembled in fear as she gathered just enough courage to call out her sister's name. <br><br>
								 
								She squeezed her eyes shut as she felt a cool sensation against her cheek. <br><br>
								 
								"Faith's not here anymore" A sinuster voice sneered. A voice that didn't belong to her sister. <br><br>
								 
								"Go to sleep." <br><br>
								 
								Then, Hope felt herself descend into darkness. <br><br>
								 
								~•~•~•~ <br><br>
								 
								2017 <br><br>
								 
								It had been 7 years since Faith disappeared. <br><br>
								 
								Their mother having thought that Hope had something to do with her disappearance, went crazy and left Hope to her own defences. <br><br>
								 
								Leaving her abandoned and alone. <br><br>
								 
								To say that she missed her twin was an understatement. She yearned or maybe even needed Faith. <br><br>
								 
								It was true that Faith had problems. But she wasn't always that way. Something made her change. <br><br>
								 
								One moment she was Faith, the next, she just wasn't. <br><br>
								 
								When did it start? <br><br>
								 
								When did it start? <br><br>
								 
								She recalled the memory. <br><br>
								 
								"Nine! Ten! Here I come!"  <br><br>
								 
								The twins' mother called as she went down the stairs. They were playing hide and seek. She already knew where they were. They always hid together, in the same spot.  <br><br>
								 
								The twins liked to stick together. <br><br>
								 
								But this time, they weren't hiding together. <br><br>
								 
								For once in their lives, the twins actually decided to go their separate ways. Yet, they still knew where the other was hiding just in case. <br><br>
								 
								Hope hid in the closet of their room while Faith took a trip to the attic. <br><br>
								 
								Once their mother found Hope, she immediately began to worry. She was terrified of the attic. It was old, and dusty, and full of stuff from their past and the pasts of old home owners. <br><br>
								 
								But after looking everywhere but there, she knew she had to go up. <br><br>
								 
								It seemed like Hope felt the same way so she went up while her mother was busy checking other places. <br><br>
								 
								She gasped when she arrived. <br><br>
								 
								Faith was holding a dead rat in her hands. <br><br>
								 
								She got Faith to wash her hand before they recomciled with their mother. <br><br>
								 
								Hope sighed before laying in her bed. It was one of those days when she swore she heard her sister's voice. <br><br>
								 
								"...pe..." <br><br>
								 
								".....ope..." <br><br>
								 
								"HOPE!" <br><br>
								 
								She bolted upright. <br><br>
								 
								"Faith!" <br><br>
								 
								She had fallen asleep. She felt her eyes widen as a familiar sent wafted through her nose. She felt the hairs on the back of her arm stand as she shivered due to the cold. <br><br>
								 
								It was strange. <br><br>
								 
								Because there currently there was supposed to be a heat wave. <br><br>
								 
								"Hope?" <br><br>
								 
								A sense of dread and hope crept through her entire body. Maybe she was going crazy. Just like Faith was. <br><br>
								 
								"Faith...?" She tested out. The name rolling on her tongue. It was so familiar, although it's been so long since she last said it. <br><br>
								 
								"Hope? Please... please help me..." <br><br>
								 
								Hope gasped pulling her covers of her body. It was Faith. <br><br>
								 
								It was definitely her. <br><br>
								 
								"Where are you?" <br><br>
								 
								She was met with no reply. <br><br>
								 
								"FAITH!" She cried out desperately and was surprised by a mewl from her right. <br><br>
								 
								There was a black cat staring straight at her. Every time she moved towards it, it walked away, glancing every few seconds to see if she was following. <br><br>
								 
								And Hope was.  <br><br>
								 
								For some unknown reason, she felt as though this was how she would find her sister. <br><br>
								 
								Before she knew it, she no longer knew where she was or how she got there. <br><br>
								 
								All she knew was that she was in deep trouble. <br><br>
								 
								~•~•~•~ <br><br>
								 
								Hope didn't know how to first describe the place, it was dark and empty and it scared her. There seemed to be no walls and a dim light at what she assumed to be the end of the room. She clutched her amulet impulsively. <br><br>
								 
								It belonged to her father, and in this cold unknown, it was surprisingly warm. <br><br>
								 
								"Where are we?" She asked the cat before shaking her head at her stupidity. <br><br>
								 
								"Nowhere."  <br><br>
								 
								She jumped in surprise as a voice answered her but no one was there except for the cat, who had stopped directly in front of her and was staring directly into her eyes. <br><br>
								 
								"Okay..." <br><br>
								 
								She felt a soft wind breeze past her, prickling her face. Then, she saw a figure walking a distance away. Ghost-like. <br><br>
								 
								"I'm not scared... I'm not scared..." <br><br>
								 
								It started to take the form of a little girl. <br><br>
								 
								Faith. <br><br>
								 
								"Okay, I am definitely scared but I'm not going anywhere." <br><br>
								 
								"Where are you taking me?" <br><br>
								 
								Her sister's voice echoed and trembled against the walls, or space. Whatever you'd call it. <br><br>
								 
								"Faith?" Her voice trembled, she didn't know what was happening but she wanted to find her sister. <br><br>
								 
								And fast. <br><br>
								 
								She took a few steps forward before the figure's face shifted into something more sinister. Something more evil. It's pitch black eyes glaring at her. <br><br>
								 
								"No... IT'S NOT YOU!" <br><br>
								 
								It screamed in a wailing voice before it suddenly disappeared and reappeared before her, grabbing her neck and squeezing. <br><br>
								 
								She felt the life being choked out of her. <br><br>
								 
								She shut her eyes tight, believing that this was the end for her. <br><br>
								 
								Before the creature suddenly screamed as if it was burned. Her amulet started glowing and she felt it heat up against her skin. <br><br>
								 
								When she opened her eyes yet again, she was in a different place, yet not at all that different. The creature long gone. <br><br>
								 
								It was the same as the last place but this time there was something noticeably different. <br><br>
								 
								In a corner of a new room, there was a big black bulge of some sort of black matter. <br><br>
								 
								Hope took three steps back from the object in fear until something that made her running towards it caught her eye. <br><br>
								 
								Faith was in it. <br><br>
								 
								She was stuck and seemed unconcious, the unknown substance sticking to her face. <br><br>
								 
								"Faith?" Hope whispered touching her sister's face before clawing at the dark substance, ripping it apart into many pieces. <br><br>
								 
								Faith blinked as their gazes met, but her eyes were slow in recognition. The two sister's immediately hugged once Faith was finally free. <br><br>
								 
								"Hope?" She asked softly before her eyes became panicked, her breathing coming out harshly. "What are you doing here?! You can't be here!" <br><br>
								 
								"What do you mean?" Hope asked, trying to calm your sister down. <br><br>
								 
								"He'll know you're here!" She shook Hope's shoulders and then her eyes zeroed in on the amulet around Hope's neck. <br><br>
								 
								"That's..." Faith touched the amulet before a look of determination crossed her face. "We have to get out of here." <br><br>
								 
								"But there's no way out." Hope whispered as she looked around. <br><br>
								 
								"You're the way out." Faith replied before she grabbed the amulet and squeezed her eyes shut. <br><br>
								 
								Once she opened her eyes, she was met with a confused Hope. "What are you doing?" <br><br>
								 
								"No way..." Faith said in disbelief. "Why won't it work...?" <br><br>
								 
								A sudden smell of arabian perfume wafted through the air and Faith cowered back, whimpering. <br><br>
								 
								"He's here..." She whispered. <br><br>
								 
								"You stupid girl, you really thought you could escape?" <br><br>
								 
								Suddenly, the two of them were surrounded by a cloud of black smoke. <br><br>
								 
								"Only one person can use the amulet!" <br><br>
								 
								Slowly, Hope started to realize what was going on. She stared at her sister's terrified expression before looking at the amulet in thier hands. It was burning hot, but they didn't seem to mind it. <br><br>
								 
								"We're doomed..." Faith whispered. <br><br>
								 
								She knew what she had to do without even fully understanding the situation. <br><br>
								 
								She snapped the chain of the amulet of her neck and forced it into Faith's hands before pushing her sister out of the dark cloud. <br><br>
								 
								"Hope! No!" Faith screamed as she was thrown out. The last thing she saw before passing out was her twin sister's sad smile. <br><br>
								 
								And she knew was that when she woke, all of Hope would be lost. <br><br>
